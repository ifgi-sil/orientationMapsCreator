# orientationMapsCreator
QGIS Plugin to create orientation maps.
This extends the [pgRoutingLayer](https://github.com/pgRouting/pgRoutingLayer) plugin. We only use the `pgr_dijkstra` for route calculation and add functionality to select *Orientation Information* based on the selected route.

Please go to the [Wiki](../../wiki) for detailed descriptions on the functionality and database setup.
